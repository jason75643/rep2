if you have two positive integers like 10 and 7, and we are subtracting 
10-7
just subtract 
10-7=3
If there is a negative, then you add them 
-10-7 or 10-(-7)
The first one, a negative minus a negative, is a bigger negative number 
However, for the second one, the two negative signs make a positive, which makes a bigger positive number
-10-7=-17
10-(-7)=17
